  - Use multiple API providers (failover)
  - Degrade gracefully (use last known weather)
  - Monitor usage closely

**Risk 2: Database Performance at Scale**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (slow app)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Database indexing strategy
  - Query optimization from day 1
  - Redis caching for hot data
  - Horizontal scaling plan ready

**Risk 3: File Storage Costs (Photos)**
- **Probability:** High
- **Impact:** Medium (cost overrun)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Image compression (WebP, quality 80%)
  - Free tier limits (1 photo per bake)
  - Cloudflare R2 (no egress fees)
  - Premium users get unlimited

**Risk 4: Third-Party Service Downtime**

  - Speed to market (12 weeks MVP)
  - Community building (loyalty)
  - Continuous innovation

**Risk 3: Seasonal Usage Patterns**

  - International markets (opposite seasons)
  - Diversify beyond bread (pastries, desserts)

**Risk 4: Free Tier Cannibalization**

- **Mitigation:**
  - Strict free tier limits (10 recipes)
  - Premium features clearly valuable
  - Gentle upsell prompts
  - Annual discount incentives

---

### 5.3 Business Risks

  - Grandfather early users (discounts)
  - Transparent pricing communication

**Risk 2: Developer Burnout**
- **Probability:** Medium (solo founder?)
- **Impact:** High (project dies)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Realistic timelines (12 weeks, not 4)
  - Scope flexibility (MVP first)
  - Celebrate small wins
  - Consider co-founder or early hire

**Risk 3: Cost Overruns**
- **Probability:** Low (using free tiers)
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Track all costs weekly
  - Use free tiers aggressively
  - Scale infrastructure with revenue
